# food-production

The presented project is a part of an ongoing global project entitled “TROP ICSU: Climate Change Education” led by the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), implemented through IISER, Pune. 

It is a global project that creates innovative pedagogical resources by implementing climate science and climate change case studies. This project aims to integrate climate change education with the core curriculum. It focuses on collecting, curating, developing, and disseminating various pedagogical resources for integrating climate change topics in regular curricula of multiple disciplines, at school and university education levels, across the globe. 

The objective of my study was to understand the impact of climate change on global food production and analyze how climate change can disrupt food availability and food security. The primary focus of this research was to understand the food production of major food-producing countries, along with understanding the impact of climate change on global food production. 

I have analyzed how changing weather patterns could have a negative impact on food production, supply, safety, and quality in different parts of the world. I have explored, in turn, how this is affecting the socio-economic development of various countries. I have also briefly studied the global efforts to mitigate these effects.

**ATTACHEMENTS**

**Codes:** 
The codes are for the Multiple Linear Regression Models that were used for our analysis, these models show us how the output changes as a function of the various input variables. In other words, the dataset's output column was influenced by numerous input columns. The output column of our linear regression model was the crop's production column. At the same time, the inputs or independent variables were a year, precipitation in millimeters, and the average temperature in degrees Celsius.

**Data:**
The secondary dataset related to the food production for the major food-producing nations was ollected from Our World in Data. The datasets were obtained for the Agricultural Sector for the years 1961 to 2018. The secondary dataset related to the surface temperature and monthly precipitation for the major food-producing nations was obtained from the World Bank Database.
